When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would use a remote repository when you want to be able to share files with and receive files from others, allowing you to collaborate more efficiently.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You may not want to have all branches being developed by all collaborators on your project in your repository to keep it less cluttered.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you 
use one instead of another?

    Forking is essentially cloning between repositories on GitHub, whereas cloning copies a repository to your local directory. repository can split into different branches to allow one to work on an alternative version of the main project while continuing to work on the original model, and then possible merge the two versions eventually. One would fork when they want a copy of a repository from another user on GitHub to modify and submit to the original creator(s). One would clone when they want a that repository in their directory to modify, and one would branch when they begin working on a modification or alternate version of the project.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Having a local copy of the last known state of the remote allows you to check your work and changes you have made against commits in the origin without having to be online or merge the two branches.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub each modification made by anyone working on the project would have to be saved in a new file or overwrite the old file, so there would either be many files or no history of changes. Collaborating would require sharing documents on something like Dropbox, which would require everyone to download the relevant files. It would also be impossible to merge branches, etc.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
